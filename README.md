# The-Puzzle-Tantrix
A game based on the puzzle Tantrix

(The introduction referes to Steve Blackburn, ANU)

This game is based on the puzzle Tantrix. 

The original version uses sixteen hexagonal tiles (known as necklaces in the mathematics of combinatorics). 

this game is based on a variation called Tantrix Match, which uses thirteen of the tiles.
(from the original sixteen it excludes the two rightmost tiles and the third from left on the top row). 

This game is a little like sudko, and simply requires organizing the thirteen tiles into a four-five-four grid, so that: 
(a) all touching edges match, called match, or harder, 
(b) that all touching edges match and one color makes a continuous (but not closed) line that passes through all tiles, called line, or harder still, 
(c) that all touching edges match and one color makes a continous loop that passes through all tiles, called loop.

The 'puzzles' are graded in difficulty, so that beginners can choose 'puzzles' that are easy. 

Easier puzzles have more tiles placed. If the player does not use a 'puzzle', they are solving the entire problem.
